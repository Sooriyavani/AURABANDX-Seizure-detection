# AURABANDX-Seizure-detection
🧠 AURABANDX: Predict, Prevent and Protect – A Wearable Approach to Seizure Detection
This project presents AurabandX, a smart wearable system designed to predict, prevent, and protect individuals from seizure episodes using sensor-based data and intelligent algorithms.

🚀 Project Overview
AurabandX is an AI-powered wearable device that continuously monitors:

🫀 Heart rate

💦 Sweat levels (Electrodermal activity)

🤸‍♀️ Motion patterns (Accelerometer and Gyroscope data)

Using this multi-sensor data, the system detects abnormal patterns and potential seizure onset, triggering real-time alerts to caregivers or emergency contacts.

🎯 Objectives
Early prediction of seizures to ensure timely intervention.

Minimize injury risk during seizure episodes.

Improve quality of life for individuals with epilepsy and related disorders.
